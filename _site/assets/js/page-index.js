The underlying principle is that no person should cause unreasonable interference with his neighbour’s enjoyment or use of that neighbour’s place of residence.</p>\n\n<p>The CDRA also establishes the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) as part of the State Courts to hear cases under the CDRA.</p>\n\n<p>The CDRA only applies to acts committed on or after the date it came into force (1 October\n2015).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"who-is-my-neighbour\">Who is my neighbour?</h3>\n\n<p>/&lt;/Insert picture here/&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Your neighbour is a person who:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Lives in the same building as you; or</li>\n  <li>Lives within a 100 metre radius of your place of residence.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your neighbour does NOT include a person who lives in the same place of residence as you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"examples-of-interference\">Examples of interference</h3>\n\n<p>/&lt;/Insert picture here/&gt;</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"evidence-that-may-be-brought-before-the-cdrt\">Evidence that may be brought before the CDRT</h3>\n\n<p>You will need to present proof (or evidence) to support your claim.

The only exception is when all parties to the proceedings agree for a party to be represented by a lawyer and the CDRT gives permission (section 29(3)(b)).</p>\n\n<p>As a general rule, a party to the proceedings must present his or her own case during the CDRT proceedings (section 29(1)). There are, however, some exceptions to this general rule. A party to the proceedings may be represented by another person in the following situations, provided that the CDRT is satisfied that the person has sufficient knowledge of the case and sufficient authority to bind the party whom he represents (section 29(5)):</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>SITUATION\n\nThe party is below 21 years old; and The CDRT is of the opinion that he is unable to present his own case.

This means that only the parties to the proceedings and the witnesses who have been called to give evidence in the proceedings are allowed to be present. Unless the Tribunal Judge orders otherwise, the following persons are not allowed to be present during the proceedings:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a. Members of the press;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>b. Members of the public; and</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>c.

A party who fails to comply with the order to attend counselling or mediation commits contempt of court, and may be fined or imprisoned.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"costs-and-disbursements\">COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS</h3>\n\n<p>Other than disbursements, the CDRT will generally not grant costs to or award costs against any party to any proceedings in the CDRT\n(section 25). The only exception is where:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a) The whole or any part of a claim is struck out or dismissed on the ground that the whole or part of the claim is frivolous or vexatious or is an abuse of the process of the CDRT; or</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>b) The CDRT is of the view that it is just and equitable to do so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>2-Year Limitation Period for Claims</strong></p>\n\n<p>All CDRT claims must be filed within 2 years from the date the cause of action accrued (section 17(3)). A cause of action is the fact\nor facts which entitles you, in law, to start a court action against the neighbour respondent. You may file a claim in the civil courts, e.g. at the Magistrate’s courts if the cause of action accrued more than 2years ago.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Maximum $20,000 Monetary Claims</strong></p>\n\n<p>The maximum monetary claim that can be brought in the CDRT is $20,000 (section 17(5)). You may file a claim in the civil courts, e.g. at the Magistrate’s courts if you are claiming more than $20,000 from the neighbour respondent.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"e-instructions-in-filing-documents-and-evidence\">(E) Instructions in Filing Documents And Evidence</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Every page must be paginated (i.e. numbered) consecutively, with the page number stated at the top right hand corner of the page.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n    <li>All documents which are not written in English must be accompanied by an official translation into English.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Where the evidence is in the form of audio or video recordings (including CCTV recordings):</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>(i) the recordings must be saved in a CD-R or DVD-R, which is labelled in the following format:</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>[Party’s name]–[CD–R or DVD–R Number]\n\nE.g.

Please see below for a step-by-step process on filing a claim in the CDRT.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Consider whether your neighbour has interfered with your enjoyment or use of your place of residence according to the CDRA.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Gather the necessary evidence to support your case.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For the purpose of the proceedings, you will be known as the Plaintiff and your neighbour will be known as the Respondent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Upon filing the application in CJTS, a <strong>Notice of Pre-Trial Conference</strong> will be generated in CJTS and issued to the Plaintiff and the Respondent to attend a PreTrial Conference at the CDRT on a specified date and at a specified time</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Within 14 days after the Claim is filed, the Plaintiff must serve one (1) set of the claim and one (1) set of the supporting evidence on the Respondent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>E.g. If the Plaintiff files the Claim on 5 February 2018, the Plaintiff must serve one (1) set of the claim and one (1) set of the supporting evidence on the Respondent by 19 February 2018 which is the last day to serve the documents</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Before the date and time fixed for the Pre-Trial Conference at the CDRT, the Plaintiff must file a <strong>Declaration of Service</strong> in CJTS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Step 7a:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the Respondent intends to object to or contest the claim, the Respondent has 14 days after being served with the claim and the supporting evidence to file his <strong>Reply</strong>, together with the supporting evidence, in CJTS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>E.g. If the Respondent receives the claim and the supporting evidence from the Plaintiff on 11 February 2018, the Respondent must file his Reply, together with the supporting evidence, by 25 February 2018 at the latest. If the last day of the period is a Sunday or a Public Holiday, the period will include the next working day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Step 7b:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Alternatively the Respondent may wish to consider resolving the matter via e-Negotiation in CJTS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Step 8:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Within the same 14-day period, the Respondent must serve one (1) set of the Reply and one (1) set of the supporting evidence on the Plaintiff.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If parties are not able to explore a resolution via e-Negotiation in CJTS, the Plaintiff and the Respondent must attend the Pre-Trial Conference at the CDRT on the specified date and the specified time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Things to bring:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>1) National Registration Identity Card (for Singapore citizen/Permanent Resident)</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>2) Passport and Employment Pass (for foreign citizen)</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>3) One (1) set of the Claim, Reply and supporting evidence</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>4) Notice of Pre-Trial Conference</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Tribunal Judge can make the following orders during a Pre-Trial Conference:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>1) Order the Plaintiff and the Respondent to attend mediation</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>2) Order the Plaintiff and/or the Respondent to attend counselling</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>3) Schedule another Pre-Trial Conference</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>4) Fix the case for hearing</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Step 10:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Where the Tribunal Judge has fixed the case for hearing, a Notice of Hearing will be issued to the Plaintiff and the Respondent to attend the hearing at the CDRT on a specified date and time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Step 11:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Plaintiff and the Respondent must attend the hearing at the CDRT on the specified date and time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Things to bring:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>1) National Registration Identity Card (for Singapore citizen/Permanent Resident)</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>2) Passport and Employment Pass (for foreign citizen)</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>3) One (1) set of the Claim, Reply and supporting evidence</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>4) Notice of Pre-Trial Conference</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If a Court Order is made, the Plaintiff is to extract the Court Order and serve a copy on the Respondent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"b-enforcing-cdrt-orders\">(B) Enforcing CDRT Orders</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"i-applying-for-a-special-direction\">(i) APPLYING FOR A SPECIAL DIRECTION</h3>\n\n<p>The Plaintiff may consider applying for a Special Direction against the Respondent (section 6). A Special Direction is a direction by the CDRT to the Respondent to comply with the order that has been made against him within a specified time. A Respondent who, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with a Special Direction commits an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine up to $5,000 or to imprisonment of up to 3 months or to both (section 7(1)).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ii-applying-for-a-person-to-enter-into-a-compliance-bond\">ii) APPLYING FOR A PERSON TO ENTER INTO A COMPLIANCE BOND</h3>\n\n<p>The Plaintiff may, at the same time as applying for a Special Direction, apply for a third party to enter into a Bond to ensure that the\nRespondent complies with the Special Direction (section 6(3)). The application is to be served on the third party to attend the proceedings and be heard before deciding whether to order him or her to enter into a Bond (section 6(5)). The CDRT may, in making an order for a third party to be bonded, impose conditions or give directions to the third party (section 6(4)). A party who fails to comply with a court order to enter into a Bond commits an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of up to $2,000 (section 6(7)).</p>\n\n<p>If the Respondent fails to comply with the Special Direction, the CDRT will arrange for the third party to show cause why his Bond should not be forfeited. If cause is shown (i.e. the third party has provided sufficient explanation), the Bond may not be forfeited in full. If cause is not shown, the bond will be forfeited in full.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"iii-applying-for-an-exclusion-order\">(iii) APPLYING FOR AN EXCLUSION ORDER</h3>\n\n<p>In the event that the Respondent still does not comply with the Special Direction, the Plaintiff may consider applying for an Exclusion Order against the Respondent (section 9). An Exclusion Order is an order by the CDRT that the Respondent be excluded from his or her place of residence. In deciding whether it is just and equitable (section 5(2)) for an exclusion order to be made, the CDRT must consider all of the following matters (section 9(4)):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a) The impact of the order on the Respondent; \nb) The impact of the order on any person who, at the time of the making of the order, resides in the Respondent’s place of residence; \nc) The impact of the order on any other person who can reasonably be expected to be affected by the order; and \nd) Any other matters as the court deems fit. A Respondent who, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with an Exclusion Order commits an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine up to $5,000 or to imprisonment of up to 3 months or to both (section 10(1)).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Instead of a fine or imprisonment, the court also has the discretion to make a Community Order against the Respondent. The Respondent may, alternatively, be punished for Contempt of Court.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"iv-contempt-of-court\">(iv) CONTEMPT OF COURT</h3>\n<p>The Respondent may be punished for Contempt of Court. The fundamental purpose underlying the law relating to contempt of court in general is to ensure that public confidence in the administration of justice is not undermined. The court may sentence the Respondent to both a fine as well as imprisonment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"c-appeals\">(C) Appeals</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"i-appeals-from-order-of-cdrt-registrar\">(i) APPEALS FROM ORDER OF CDRT REGISTRAR</h3>\n\n<p>Rule 15 of the CDRA Rules provides that an appeal may be made to a Tribunal Judge from any judgment, order or direction of the Registrar. The appeal is brought by serving on the other party a notice filed in the relevant form to attend before the Tribunal Judge.</p>\n\n<p>Unless the Court otherwise orders, the notice must be issued within 14 days after the judgment, order or direction appealed against was given or made and served on all other parties within 7 days of it being issued.

The Respondent also used objects such as umbrellas and scissors to hit the windows, gate and main door of the Plaintiff’s flat, causing some minor damage. In addition, the Respondent repeatedly loitered along the common corridor outside the Plaintiff’s flat and scolded, cursed and made highly abusive or insulting comments about the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff’s family in a very loud voice.</p>\n\n<p>The Respondent also stalked the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff’s family members.

The Respondent’s flat is a corner unit, while the Plaintiff’s flat is on the left of the Respondent’s flat. There is a sliding window (belonging to the Plaintiff’s flat) between the main entrance of the Respondent’s flat and the main entrance of the Plaintiff’s flat.</p>\n\n<p>The Respondent placed a metal shoe rack, a red metal incense burner, a bicycle and some other miscellaneous items under the Plaintiff’s sliding window. After the Plaintiff sought the Town Council’s assistance, the Town Council officer instructed the Respondent to remove the bicycle, which he did. According to the Plaintiff and the Respondent, the Town Council told the Respondent that he could continue placing the metal shoe rack below the Plaintiff’s window.</p>\n\n<p>During court proceedings, the Plaintiff and the Respondent did not exhibit any written permission from the Town Council to that effect. The Plaintiff sought an order for the Respondent to remove all items at the common corridor, in particular, the items below the Plaintiff’s window.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ORDER</strong></p>\n\n<p>After hearing both parties, a Tribunal Order was made against the Respondent to remove all the Respondent’s items outside the corridor of the Plaintiff’s flat</p>\n\n<p><strong>Grounds for Order</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>The items placed outside the Plaintiff’s flat interfered with the Plaintiff’s enjoyment of her premises, when the Plaintiff goes in and out of her flat and when the Plaintiff opens her window. The items prevented the Plaintiff from cleaning her windows and surroundings.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Each flat owner has the right to the space inside the flat but not outside the flat where the common corridor is located. The common corridor falls under the purview of the Town Council. In this case, there was a Town Council By-Law that stated that no one shall obstruct or cause or permit the obstruction of the lawful use of the common property with any object, fixture or thing.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The Respondent was at liberty to keep the shoe rack inside the Respondent’s flat.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The Plaintiff requested for and the Respondent was ordered to pay the disbursements for the CDRT filing fees and IRAS search fee to obtain the Respondent’s name to file the claim.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"c-dismissal\">(C) Dismissal</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"a-section-42a-causing-excessive-noise\">a) Section 4(2)(a) Causing excessive noise</h3>\n\n<p><strong>BABYSITTING BLUES</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Plaintiff’s flat was directly below the Respondent’s flat. The Plaintiff alleged that the Respondent made excessive noises which were described as heavy running, stomping and thumping, dragging of furniture and dropping of items onto the floor. The occurrence of the noises coincided with the presence of the Respondent’s two year old granddaughter, for whom the Respondent was the main caregiver while the girl’s parents were at work.</p>\n\n<p>The Respondent’s case was that any noises that might have been generated were reasonable noises associated with the movements and activities of a young child in a home setting. As the parties could not settle the dispute through mediation, the case proceeded for trial.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Case Dismissed</strong></p>\n\n<p>At the end of the trial, the Plaintiff’s Claim was dismissed as he had not proven on a balance of probabilities that the noises that he had been hearing in his flat had originated from the Respondent’s flat alone and that it was the Respondent or her family members who had caused the noises intentionally, recklessly or negligently.</p>\n\n<p>There was also no evidence to suggest that the noises were “excessive” in that they exceeded household noises or lifestyle noises that are generated through ordinary instances of daily living that can be expected to be tolerated by reasonable persons living in Singapore, and that the noises caused “unreasonable interference” to the Plaintiff’s use or enjoyment of his flat.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"d-withdrawal\">(D) Withdrawal</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"i-section-42a-causing-excessive-noise-1\">(i) Section 4(2)(a) Causing excessive noise</h3>\n\n<p><strong>ELDERLY RELATIVES</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Plaintiff’s flat was directly below the Respondent’s flat. The Plaintiff alleged that every morning from about 6.45am to 8.15am, she would hear noises from the Respondent’s flat, including slamming of the door, sliding and slamming of the window grilles, sounds of footwear and sounds of dragging of furniture in the living room.</p>\n\n<p>At the first Pre-trial Conference (PTC), the CDRT Judge was informed that the Respondent lived with her uncle and her elderly aunts and that all the ladies wore slippers at home to protect their feet against the coldness of the floor. The CDRT Judge was also informed that the uncle and elderly aunts woke up early every morning, which coincided with the period that the Plaintiff heard the noises. The elderly aunts also did their laundry and hung them out to dry at about 6–7am. In addition, the sliding aluminium window grilles were more than 15 years old.</p>\n\n<p>During the case management session, the CDRT Judge explored with the Respondent on what the possible causes of the noises were and how they could be remedied. The Respondent agreed to do the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Explore alternative footwear for herself and her aunts.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Replace the stoppers at the base of all the dining chairs in the flat to those that were of softer material and provided more cushioning.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>For the aunts to do the laundry and hang out the laundry at a later time.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When parties returned for the second PTC, the Plaintiff informed the CDRT Judge that the footwear noises had totally disappeared and the noise from the dragging of furniture had reduced, although the noise from the sliding of the window grilles was still present. The Respondent agreed to purchase lubricant for the window grilles to reduce the friction whenever they were opened or closed.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of the improvement to the noises and in the spirit of good neighbourliness, the Plaintiff withdrew the Claim.</p>\n\n",
